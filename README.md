To complete assignment for OASIS INFOBYTE Java development Internship, I have made below 2 different Java Programs using Simple Java GUI. 

<h1>Task 1 - Online Exam </h1><br> 
 
<b>&#127793;Java Classes Used &#127793;</b>
<br><i>
<ul>
<li>Exam Login Class</li> 
<li>Exam Function Class</li>
</i></ul>
<br>  
<b>&#127797;The functionality of the Project &#127797;</b><br>

There are 7 questions to play in this project. Any question can be saved by the user for later review while seeing the results.
Instead of using a database, I used an array to store the questions, options, and answers.

<br>
<b>&#127793;The functionality of the Project &#127793;</b><br>

Java language OOP concepts like inheritance are used in the development of the Java ATM project. In this project, I've used Java to implement some of the fundamental capabilities of an ATM, such as the ability to withdraw money, deposit, Transfer, and checking Transaction History.  By entering the proper Customer Number and PIN, users can use ATMs.
